lib's mostly for my own use and for advanced users that feel\n  comfortable reading this source. Not providing much beginner-oriented\n  documentation for this, sorry.\n\n  Quick Taoensso naming conventions:\n    **foo** - Dynamic var.\n    foo!    - Fn with side effects, or that should otherwise be used cautiously.\n    foo?    - Truthy val or fn that returns truthy val.\n    foo!?   - Fn that has side effetcs (or requires caution) and that returns\n              a truthy val. Note: !?, not ?!.\n    foo$    - Fn that's notably expensive to compute (e.g. hits db).\n    foo_    - Dereffable val (e.g. atom, volatile, delay, etc.).\n    _       - Unnamed val.\n    _foo    - Named but unused val.\n    ?foo    - Optional val (emphasize that val may be nil).\n    foo*    - A variation of `foo` (e.g. `foo*` macro vs `foo` fn).\n    -foo    - Public implementation detail or intermediate (e.g. uncoerced) val.\n    >foo    - Val \\\"to foo\\\" (e.g. >sender, >host), or fn to put/coerce/transform.\n    <foo    - Val \\\"from foo\\\" (e.g. <sender, <host), or fn to take/coerce/transform.\n    ->foo   - Fn to put/coerce/transform.\"\n\n  {:author \"Peter Taoussanis (@ptaoussanis)\"}\n\n  (:refer-clojure :exclude\n    [defonce if-not cond format bytes?\n     run! some? ident? float? boolean? uri? indexed?\n     int? pos-int? neg-int? nat-int?\n     simple-ident?   qualified-ident?\n     simple-symbol?  qualified-symbol?\n     simple-keyword? qualified-keyword?\n     merge merge-with])\n\n       \n           \n                            \n                            \n                           \n                                                      \n                                         \n                                       \n                                     \n                              \n\n       \n          \n                                   \n                               \n                                        \n                                              \n    \n\n        \n  (:require\n   [clojure.string      :as str]\n   [clojure.set         :as set]\n   ;; [cljs.core.async  :as async]\n   [cljs.reader]\n   [cljs.tools.reader.edn :as edn]\n   [cljs.test             :as test :refer-macros [is]]\n   ;;[goog.crypt.base64 :as base64]\n   [goog.object         :as gobj]\n   [goog.string         :as gstr]\n   [goog.string.format]\n   [goog.string.StringBuffer]\n   [goog.events         :as gevents]\n   [goog.net.XhrIo      :as gxhr]\n   [goog.net.XhrIoPool  :as gxhr-pool]\n   [goog.Uri.QueryData  :as gquery-data]\n   [goog.structs        :as gstructs]\n   [goog.net.EventType]\n   [goog.net.ErrorCode]\n   [taoensso.truss :as truss])\n\n        \n  (:require-macros\n   [taoensso.encore :as enc-macros :refer\n    [have have! have? compile-if if-not if-lets when-lets defonce cond cond!\n     catching -cas! now-dt* now-udt* now-nano* -gc-now? name-with-attrs\n     -vol! -vol-reset! -vol-swap! deprecated new-object]]))\n\n;; TODO Could really do with a portable ^boolean hint\n\n(comment \"\u2115 \u2124 \u211d \u221e \u2260 \u2208 \u2209\"\n  (set! *unchecked-math* :warn-on-boxed)\n  (set! *unchecked-math* false))\n\n;;;; Truss aliases (for back compatibility, convenience)\n\n(do\n                                                            \n                                                            \n                                                            \n                                                            \n  (defn      get-dynamic-assertion-data [] (truss/get-dynamic-assertion-data))\n                                                \n                                                         )\n\n;;;; Version check (for dependency conflicts, etc.)\n\n(do\n  (declare parse-version)\n  (def             encore-version [2 79 1])\n  (defn assert-min-encore-version [min-version]\n    (let [[xc yc zc] encore-version\n          [xm ym zm] (if (vector? min-version) min-version (:version (parse-version min-version)))\n          [xm ym zm] (mapv #(or % 0) [xm ym zm])]\n\n      (when-not (or (> xc xm) (and (= xc xm) (or (> yc ym) (and (= yc ym) (>= zc zm)))))\n        (throw\n          (ex-info \"Insufficient `com.taoensso/encore` version.
