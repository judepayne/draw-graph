This is one of them.\\n\\ndraw-graph came about because I\u2019ve found graph diagrams extremely useful in the past, but I\u2019ve found that the fully featured tools like Graphviz are not that accessible to the non-technical user or they make you use a gui to construct a graph visually, node by node, and that's laborious.\\n\\nThere are lots of Excel experts and a a lot of data lying around in spreadsheets or can be got into spreadsheets though. So draw-graph has a csv input format.\\n\\nThe backend of draw-graph runs on Amazon AWS Lambda.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\")\n\n\n;; -------------------------\n;; Page\n\n(defn about-page []\n  [:div.block-text\n   [:p (utils/md->hiccup page-content)]])\n\n\n"]}
