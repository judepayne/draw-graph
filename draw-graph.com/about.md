There are lots of graph/ networking diagramming tools online. This is one of them.

draw-graph came about because I’ve found graph diagrams extremely useful in the past, but I’ve found that the fully featured tools like Graphviz are not that accessible to the non-technical user or they put GUI interaction first meaning that it’s laborious to constructs diagrams from data that you have lying around. draw-graph has a csv format which means that any suitable data from Excel can be converted into the input format.

The backend of draw-graph runs on Amazon AWS Lambda.

Enjoy!
