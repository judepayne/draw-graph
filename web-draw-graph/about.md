There are lots of graph/ networking diagramming tools online. This is one of them.

draw-graph came about because I’ve found graph diagrams extremely useful in the past, but I’ve found that the fully featured tools like Graphviz are not that accessible to the non-technical user or they make you use a gui to construct a graph visually, node by node, and that's laborious.

There are lots of Excel experts and a a lot of data lying around in spreadsheets or can be got into spreadsheets through. So draw-graph has a csv input format.

The backend of draw-graph runs on Amazon AWS Lambda.

Enjoy!
